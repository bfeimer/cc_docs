# About ClinicCases

ClinicCases is a web-based case management system designed specifically for law school clinics. Because law school clinics get new practitioners every year (sometimes every semester), ClinicCases is designed to be easy-to-use with a minimal learning curve.  It was first released in 2007 and has undergone revisions and upgrades continually since that time.

ClinicCases is developed by [Judson Mitchell](http://law.loyno.edu/bio/r-judson-mitchell), an Associate Clincal Professor at [Loyola College of Law, New Orleans](http://law.loyno.edu).
